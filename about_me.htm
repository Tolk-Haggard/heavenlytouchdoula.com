       <p><h4>My name is Casey Haggard and I am the proud owner of Heavenly Touch Doula Services. I am a mother of 8 children and have been married to my husband Brian for 16 years.
       Brian and I are high school sweethearts and we had our first baby when we were 16 years old.
       </h4></p><p><h4>Though I was very young, my love and interest for childbirth started my journey.
       I worked in labor and delivery as an EMT 14 years ago. At that time I decided to stop working and take care and homeschool our children. Since having my last baby Madison,
       I decided to continue my journey.
       </h4></p><p><h4>I have since started training through <a href="http://www.childbirthinternational.com/">Childbirth International</a> as a birth Doula.
       My hope is to start my working towards my RN and eventually get my Midwife degree.
       </h4></p><p><h4>My philosophy on childbirth is that I know that a woman needs to feel emotionally and physically
       supported during her labor, birth and postpartum period. During this glorious time you have a beautiful story to write. This is your time, your story! You can rest assured in
       knowing that I will help you in achieving the birth you want!</h4></p>
