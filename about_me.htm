	    <h2>What is a doula?</h2>
        <p>A birth doula supports you and your partner by providing the knowledge, comfort, and education necessary for a fulfilling birth experience, using techniques such as:
		</p>
		<p><ul>
		  <li>Massage</li>
		  <li>Breathing Techniques and Vocalization</li>
		  <li>Counterpressure</li>
		  <li>Visualization</li>
		  <li>Relaxation</li>
		  <li>Education and Advocacy</li>
		</ul></p>
		<p>Doula support allows the laboring woman's partner a greater sense of how to help the laboring mother physically and emotionally. Therefore doula support can help the partner adjust to welcoming a new addition to the family.

	   <h2>About Me</h2>
	  </div>
      <div class="row">
       <p><h5>My name is Casey Haggard and I am a birth and postpartum doula and a birth photographer. I am a mother of 8 children and have been married to my high school sweetheart Brian for 17 years.
       </h5></p>
	   <p><h5>My journey to become a mother was quicker than I anticipated. I had my first child when I was 17. Though a completely terrifying time I wouldn't change it for the world! Gabriel is an amazing young man! Having Gabriel is what shaped me into who I am and what I wanted to do with my life. Since then I have had 8 children and my husband has always been an incredible support through all my pregnancies. We have had some very serious pregnancy issues with Uterine Dydelphus, NAIT (Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia), MTHFR, Protein S Deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia, Hyperplasia (w/o atypia), 5 miscarriages and severe Postpartum Depression. Although my husband was an amazing support he didn't quite know how to advocate for the things that I wanted. We were both naive for most of my pregnancies and just let the doctors do whatever intervention they wanted. My last miscarriage was when I decided that I wanted to help women advocate for themselves. I wanted to help them find their voice. Because during that time with my miscarriage I lost my voice and wish I had someone there to guide me.
       </h5></p>
	   <p><h5>My education includes: a diploma in Patient Care. I have also worked in the Emergency Department and Labor and Delivery as an EMT 14 years ago. At that time I decided to stop working, take care and homeschool my children. Since having my last baby Madison, I decided to continue my journey. I am a Certified Birth Doula through <a href="http://www.childbirthinternational.com/">Childbirth International</a> and a Certified Postpartum Doula through Doula Builders. I am currently certifying through <a href="http://www.birtharts.com/">Birth Arts International</a> as a Midwife Assistant.
